## Features

- **Filtering**: Removes lowly expressed genes using `edgeR::filterByExpr`.
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using `DESeq2`.
- **Enrichment Analysis**:
  - Performs Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment using `clusterProfiler`.
  - Converts gene SYMBOLs to ENTREZ IDs using `org.Hs.eg.db`.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generates dot plots for enriched pathways.
  - Creates GO term similarity tree plots.
- **Export**:
  - Saves results in user-friendly formats (Excel files and PNG plots).
