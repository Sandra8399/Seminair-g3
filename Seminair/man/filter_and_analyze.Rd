\title{Filter RNA-seq Counts and Identify DEGs}
\usage{
filter_and_analyze(counts_file, samples_file, output_dir = "output")
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_file}{Path to the RNA-seq counts file.}

\item{samples_file}{Path to the sample metadata file.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory to save results. Defaults to "output".}
}
\value{
A list containing filtered counts and significant DEGs.
}
\description{
This function filters lowly expressed genes from RNA-seq count data using EdgeR's `filterByExpr` method
and identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DESeq2.
Filtered counts and DEGs are saved to the specified output directory.
